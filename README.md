# Math Expression Recognition Project

This repository is an educational project created by students Cherepennikov and Sorvachev.  
The project builds a system capable of solving simple mathematical expressions from photos using:

- a custom PyTorch-based Convolutional Neural Network,
- OpenCV for computer vision preprocessing,
- a Telegram bot interface for user interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- Image preprocessing and symbol extraction  
- Custom CNN model for classification of digits and operators  
- Automatic expression reconstruction  
- Expression solving  
- Telegram bot for easy usage
